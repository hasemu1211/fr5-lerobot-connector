## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Execution consumers preserve reference and trajectory meaning

A learned-action consumer SHALL distinguish recorded controller references,
observed feedback and timed executable waypoints. The existing finite learned
proposal SHALL retain its current exact-waypoint validation; rejection there
SHALL NOT by itself establish that a demonstration is unsafe or that a policy
cannot be consumed under a different explicitly qualified contract. A new target
consumer SHALL retain the original policy output identity and bind any selection,
timing or command transformation to the exact plan. It SHALL reuse the existing
motion lifecycle owner and SHALL NOT inherit physical approval from offline
prediction or recorded demonstration success.

#### Scenario: A gripper reference changes before feedback follows

- **WHEN** recorded command and feedback evidence show a held target followed by later published feedback
- **THEN** interpretation distinguishes the requested target from a measured continuous finger trajectory
- **AND** any target consumer uses its explicitly bound completion tolerance and timeout rather than assuming arrival within one dataset frame.

#### Scenario: The same held target is consumed again

- **WHEN** a bounded target consumer receives the same active target again
- **THEN** it does not create a second motion owner or restart an unresolved goal
- **AND** arm coordination, cancellation, fresh observations and terminal outcome evidence remain owned by the existing executor.

#### Scenario: A proposed mapping would hide a policy-output violation

- **WHEN** original outputs exceed admitted physical limits or cannot satisfy the declared consumption contract
- **THEN** the consumer rejects or reports the unresolved limitation without silently clipping or relabeling outputs as successful execution
- **AND** an alternative mapping requires explicit plan-bound semantics and its own verification before physical use.

### Requirement: Finite learned held targets use the sole execution owner

An explicit held-gripper proposal SHALL bind absolute j1..j6 radians and gripper
joint meters to the existing source program, immutable policy/observation identity
and exact reviewed plan. It SHALL preserve all position limits, arm velocity
limits, maximum 50 rows and 30 Hz, and a planned duration of at most five seconds
including gripper holds. Existing per-goal deadlines and lease/cancel timeouts
SHALL remain enforced. Unbound gripper targets and staged-open profiles SHALL fail;
the consumer SHALL NOT infer semantic phases, snap outputs or relax the separate
seven-joint waypoint contract.

Consecutive identical gripper references SHALL share one bound hold, consumed by
the existing PickupExecutor and RosMoveItTransport. A redundant initial hold MAY
be omitted before plan approval when its observed reference/feedback already
satisfy the bound target. No subsequent arm slice SHALL dispatch before a required
hold has successful action terminal evidence, valid reference/feedback and the
fresh same-incarnation, same-command native completion evidence defined below.
Each arm slice SHALL use a fresh observed start as an admission check and retained
evidence for its frozen commands, never as authority for runtime replan/rebase.
Observation age SHALL be rechecked after deserialization at send; original policy
generation-time source freshness and current execution-state freshness SHALL still apply. Cancel or unresolved goals SHALL fence
all later dispatches under the same transport owner.
At a segment start or terminal handoff, either controller reporting nonpositive
speed scaling SHALL reject with `LEARNED_CONTROLLER_PAUSED`, including when its
action result and reference/feedback otherwise pass. Canonical trace validation
SHALL enforce the same observation rule. Positive scaling SHALL NOT substitute
for same-command hardware completion.

Plan-only SHALL send no motion, start no recorder, mutate no scene/cell or data,
and create no approval. Execution SHALL retain existing human, exact-plan,
hardware, scene/cell, training and physical-binding authority. Per-segment evidence
SHALL remain in the existing canonical learned trace and diagnostic, with task
effectiveness and scene outcome UNKNOWN, online policy authority false, and no
automatic dataset commit or safe-reset claim.

#### Scenario: Held reference completes with different valid feedback

- **WHEN** a frozen proposal repeats a 0.01176 m bound reference
- **THEN** the transport sends only one gripper hold for that consecutive run
- **AND** feedback of 0.01218 m alone does not authorize the next arm slice
- **AND** a successful action result plus the actual bound feedback range,
  reference and fresh same-command hardware completion permits a fresh start
  check for the approved arm slice
- **AND** every sent arm target remains identical to its approved message

CPU replay proves the software boundary with serialized native evidence. It does
not establish that an actual hardware worker completed a physical command,
that arm controllers start coherently, or that a pickup succeeds.

#### Scenario: Failure cannot advance a learned slice

- **WHEN** state is stale, the reference/feedback is outside its binding, arm
  start differs beyond its approved tolerance, or an action fails or is canceled
- **THEN** the current lifecycle reports a typed failure and sends no later slice
- **AND** unresolved cancellation remains owned by the existing transport
- **AND** a late completion snapshot cannot restore dispatch after cancellation

#### Scenario: Model output does not match the supported target contract

- **WHEN** output exceeds a joint position or arm velocity bound, names/units or
  full seven-dimensional shape disagree, a target lacks its source profile, or
  the hold schedule exceeds its bound
- **THEN** admission fails before any command or recorder effect
- **AND** small floating-point representation differences within the existing
  reference tolerance preserve the original target rather than snapping it

#### Scenario: Collision admission covers held-target execution

- **WHEN** a held proposal is planned
- **THEN** existing collision admission samples each frozen arm slice, gripper
  travel and both acceptable feedback extremes intersected with URDF limits
- **AND** an invalid sample rejects before approval or execution
- **AND** sampled collision and CPU replay evidence do not qualify physical pickup

### Requirement: Continuous-reference deployment preserves hardware completion meaning

A continuous model-output consumer SHALL preserve the original full seven-joint
outputs and identify exactly which rows its frozen approved plan consumes. It
SHALL NOT silently snap references, infer close/open/release phases, truncate the
output horizon or inherit a scripted qualification. Reference position limits
SHALL be checked before the hardware's own clamping can conceal a violation.
The existing staged release SHALL remain unchanged and unsupported until the
consumer preserves its ordered intermediate hold and final open when executed.

Hardware integer command resolution SHALL NOT be treated as the raw-reference
enqueue rule or as task semantics. Before an arm segment follows a gripper
operation, the sole execution owner SHALL require fresh, same-command evidence
of hardware completion and arm resume, together with the bound controller
terminal result, reference and feedback. An unresolved/pending command, stale
or unrelated completion, hardware error or cancellation SHALL prevent dispatch.
Elapsed hold time, matching position or JTC success alone SHALL NOT manufacture
this evidence. The held-target evidence contract below supplies the bounded
source/transport path; continuous-reference consumption remains unimplemented.
Generation SHALL be bound to hardware incarnation; generation zero at activation
SHALL NOT be interpreted as a completed command. Source sample time SHALL carry
an explicit clock domain and a valid freshness comparison; callback arrival time
alone SHALL NOT make a retained hardware sample fresh. Equal scaling factors
SHALL NOT be accepted as proof that independent controllers share a start phase.
Known stop/error SHALL fence the next SDK motion call, without claiming that an
already in-flight call can be undone or that action cancellation is a safety stop.

#### Scenario: Paused controller cannot authorize a learned handoff

- **WHEN** either controller reports zero scaling at a held segment start or
  successful terminal observation
- **THEN** the sole executor rejects without sending the next segment
- **AND** a completed canonical trace containing that observation also rejects
- **AND** the transport's independent monotonic deadline continues to apply
  while a controller's trajectory time is frozen, using its existing cancel owner

#### Scenario: Continuous references and a staged source are unsupported

- **WHEN** finite inference supplies in-limit continuous gripper references
  that lack the existing exact close/open binding
- **THEN** OneJob rejects before executor or recorder effects
- **AND** a source with staged release rejects as unsupported rather than
  deleting its intermediate stage
- **AND** the original model references and source are not rewritten

#### Scenario: Integer-code equivalence does not establish command equivalence

- **WHEN** raw references 0.01041 m and 0.01053 m both map to SDK target 50
  with upper position 0.021 m
- **THEN** evidence preserves that the current hardware can enqueue again
  because the raw-reference difference exceeds 0.0001 m
- **AND** no completion, throughput or safety claim follows from integer equality

### Requirement: Held execution identities remain bound through existing quality consumers

The sole executor SHALL emit each held subsegment's distinct index and count from
its exact approved plan. Canonical phase-event validation SHALL require that plan
for multi-segment records, verify the plan/run and step evidence bindings, and
reject non-integer or out-of-range indices/counts, inconsistent declarations,
duplicate identities and reversed segment order. Legacy index 0/count 1 events
SHALL retain their existing representation. Validation SHALL use the existing
finite learned proposal bounds; a sidecar declaration SHALL NOT authorize an
arbitrary multi-segment execution.

Existing episode, timing, joint and interaction quality consumers SHALL carry
the same plan through canonical phase/row joining. Joint metrics SHALL select the
actual indexed child step, excluding gripper holds from arm-motion metrics.
Learned close/lift interaction meaning SHALL remain explicitly unqualified;
available timing or joint metrics SHALL NOT imply task success or dataset admission.

#### Scenario: Three held subsegments have different recorder row counts

- **WHEN** the existing emitter and report consumer observe bound subsegments
  0, 1 and 2 with respectively 1, 2 and 3 same-clock recorder rows
- **THEN** timing preserves counts [1, 2, 3] and reports exactly 6 joined rows
- **AND** arm metrics use the actual targets of arm children 0 and 2
- **AND** gripper child 1 is not counted as an arm trajectory
- **AND** interaction quality remains NOT_AVAILABLE with LEARNED_INTERACTION_UNQUALIFIED

#### Scenario: Segment metadata cannot be trusted against its plan

- **WHEN** the plan is absent or mismatched, a step evidence digest belongs to
  another child, or a segment event is duplicated or out of order
- **THEN** the canonical consumer rejects instead of reporting overwritten row
  counts as AVAILABLE

### Requirement: Shared chunk diagnostics retain each exact plan identity

Existing quality consumers SHALL accept an explicit digest-to-plan lookup when
reading one task's shared phase stream. Every referenced plan SHALL match its
canonical digest and run; each event SHALL retain its original global sequence,
plan and segment evidence binding. Repeated phase names in different plans SHALL
remain distinct, while duplicate identities within one plan SHALL be rejected.
Missing terminals, sequence gaps, clock mismatch and overlapping row windows
SHALL remain visible across the full stream before selecting a plan's metrics.

Each existing quality attribute and episode report SHALL retain one exact
`plan_digest`; the lookup digest is source provenance, not an aggregate plan.
Timing and joint metrics SHALL select that plan's rows and targets, and interaction
evidence SHALL bind that same plan. Legacy single-plan callers SHALL retain their
existing representation. Learned interaction remains unqualified. This read-side
contract SHALL NOT authorize a subsequent chunk or establish complete-task success;
canonical multi-chunk execution history and its live caller remain separate work.

#### Scenario: Two chunks repeat three held subsegments

- **WHEN** two exact plans in the same run each emit segments 0, 1 and 2 into
  one globally sequenced stream with twelve distinct recorder rows
- **THEN** each plan's existing report retains its own six rows, targets and digest
- **AND** the full stream and plan lookup remain attributable source evidence
- **AND** another plan's terminal cannot complete a missing terminal in the first
- **AND** a missing, altered or cross-run plan, malformed binding or duplicate
  same-plan event is rejected before producing joined quality evidence

### Requirement: Offline solver evidence must separate numerical and deployed usefulness

Rollout's offline native comparison SHALL reuse canonical checkpoint admission
and saved processors, pairing each candidate with the same observation and
explicit noise. It SHALL report all expert evaluations, total chunk and solver
wall time, action dtype and per-dimension postprocessed deviation from native
Euler10. Fixed10 SHALL be labeled a native numerical reference, not ground truth.
Synthetic exact ODE errors SHALL remain separately labeled dimensionless evidence.
Unmeasured memory, task success and physical qualification SHALL NOT be inferred
from solver work or internal vector changes. Candidate outputs SHALL NOT become
executable proposals or new execution authority through this experiment.

#### Scenario: A shorter update uses a remaining-interval midpoint

- **WHEN** the partial AdaVLA candidate integrates `v=t` from zero at `t=1`
- **THEN** its bounded result is reproduced independently from local midpoint RK2
- **AND** all 20 evaluations and its forced tail are visible alongside the six-NFE local control
- **AND** agreement with paper equations does not label this rule a local error bound

#### Scenario: Better ODE accuracy differs from native action fidelity

- **WHEN** a candidate improves exact error on a synthetic field but moves farther from fixed10
- **THEN** both comparisons remain visible without a task-success or adoption verdict
- **AND** Learning's evaluation protocol and actual downstream evidence determine usefulness

### Requirement: Saved model construction preserves declared precision

The native loader SHALL preserve saved model-construction settings that determine
parameter precision. Identical checkpoint bytes and an identical AMP setting
SHALL NOT alone establish numerically equivalent inference across loaders.

#### Scenario: A saved constructor setting affects parameter precision

- **WHEN** native reload reads the saved `load_vlm_weights` setting
- **THEN** it preserves that value rather than forcing a different constructor
- **AND** cache-only loading, canonical admission and saved processor checks remain in force.

### Requirement: Saved processor configuration must preserve the native feature contract

Learning's canonical checkpoint validator SHALL require a saved preprocessor declaration of
`observation.state` as `STATE` with shape `[7]`, and a saved postprocessor
declaration of `action` as `ACTION` with shape `[7]`. If the state normalizer
specifies `normalize_observation_keys`, it SHALL be a list of strings containing
`observation.state`. Incompatible declarations SHALL fail before model loading.
The canonical validator SHALL reject nonempty inline `stats` overrides in either normalizer
so the validated saved normalization tensors remain the statistics source.
The native Rollout loader SHALL consume this artifact validation through
`validate_checkpoint(..., verify_dataset=True)`; Rollout SHALL NOT maintain a
separate saved-artifact validation policy.

#### Scenario: Normalization tensors exist but state processing is excluded

- **WHEN** the saved state normalization tensors are present and valid but the
  feature declaration is absent, has an incompatible type/shape, or its filter
  excludes `observation.state`
- **THEN** canonical validation rejects, surfaced by the native loader as
  `LEARNED_CHECKPOINT_LOAD_FAILED`
- **AND** no model is loaded, inference performed or plan produced

#### Scenario: Saved action declaration disagrees with the native output layout

- **WHEN** the saved postprocessor does not declare a seven-dimensional `ACTION`
  feature named `action`
- **THEN** native admission rejects before model loading

#### Scenario: Inline statistics supersede the saved tensors

- **WHEN** either saved normalizer configuration contains a nonempty `stats`
  override despite valid saved tensors
- **THEN** canonical validation rejects, surfaced by the native loader as
  `LEARNED_CHECKPOINT_LOAD_FAILED`
- **AND** no model is loaded

#### Scenario: Valid saved configuration applies normalization

- **WHEN** the declarations, existing normalization checks and optional explicit
  state filter satisfy the native contract
- **THEN** the loader consumes the original saved processors and statistics
- **AND** the preprocessor transforms the state according to those saved tensors
- **AND** this readiness check grants no training, execution, physical
  qualification or task-effectiveness authority

### Requirement: Shared native policy inference must have one active consumer

A loaded native policy instance SHALL reject overlapping calls before resetting
or invoking its model or saved processors, including calls from separate finite
proposal consumers. This runtime guard SHALL release after success or failure
so sequential reuse remains possible.

#### Scenario: Two finite proposal consumers share a loaded policy

- **WHEN** one consumer is predicting and a second invokes the same native instance
- **THEN** the second call fails with `LEARNED_REENTRANT_INFERENCE`, surfaced by
  the finite proposal consumer as `LEARNED_POLICY_FAILED`
- **AND** the second call does not reset the shared model or produce a proposal
- **AND** the first consumer can finish without interference

#### Scenario: A prior inference has returned or failed

- **WHEN** another finite proposal consumer invokes the native instance
- **THEN** it can perform a fresh inference using the same model and processors
- **AND** proposal timing, cancellation and execution authority checks still apply

### Requirement: Held completion has native command and clock identity

The existing hardware worker SHALL publish diagnostic state interfaces through
`fr5_gripper_execution` on the existing `DynamicJointState` broadcaster. The
record SHALL retain activation incarnation, exact integer command generation,
active/completed generation, original reference in joint meters, raw feedback,
completion reason, pending/RPC/stop/error and arm-resume state. Activation SHALL
renew incarnation and reset generation; generation zero is observation only.
Generation SHALL remain exactly representable in the wire doubles; exhaustion
SHALL reject a further command. This adds no command endpoint or motion owner.

The record SHALL retain separate raw controller calendar values for the current
sample and the completion sample, plus host SYSTEM and steady sample time and
command-start SYSTEM time. A cached SDK read SHALL NOT acquire source freshness
merely because a callback or read occurred recently. Completion reason describes
native motion-done or settled-away logic, never grasp/task semantics.

The runtime owner SHALL supply a measured `fr5.gripper_source_clock.v1` binding
through the existing executor's `--gripper-source-clock` file argument. Its fields
are `incarnation` (four uint32 words), `calendar_to_system_offset_s`,
`uncertainty_s`, `system_anchor_s`, `steady_anchor_s`, and
`valid_until_system_s`, all times in seconds. Calendar-to-SYSTEM comparison SHALL
use the supplied offset and uncertainty, without assuming controller timezone.
The binding SHALL be valid at observation/send time on the same host and hardware
incarnation; SYSTEM elapsed time SHALL agree with steady elapsed time within its
uncertainty. Both endpoints of the mapped source interval SHALL satisfy the
existing observation age bound. Missing/expired binding, paused/changed clock,
stale or malformed state SHALL reject before a learned send.

A required hold's terminal observation SHALL have no pending/active RPC,
stop/error or unresolved generation and SHALL show native arm resume. Its
completed generation SHALL equal the current generation and be exactly one
beyond the pre-send observation. Its completion source interval SHALL be after
command start and fresh at handoff. ARM slices and adjacent segment observations
SHALL retain the same incarnation/generation. After JTC success, fresh evidence of
the one expected pending command MAY remain owned by the same transport until
qualified completion or the original phase deadline. This wait SHALL NOT resend
a gripper goal, extend the deadline/lease or advance an arm. Stale/paused clocks,
wrong incarnation/generation/reference, hardware error/stop and inconsistent
completion SHALL fail immediately; these failures are not retryable waits.
Canonical trace validation SHALL consume the same completion checks and retain
clock binding and monotonic capture time.

The existing native driver MAY require this same measured clock contract with
the default-false hardware parameter `require_gripper_source_clock`. When
enabled, its framework-managed hardware node SHALL expose one atomic
`gripper_source_clock_v1` double-array parameter. The encoding SHALL be
`[1, incarnation_0, incarnation_1, incarnation_2, incarnation_3,
calendar_to_system_offset_s, uncertainty_s, system_anchor_s, steady_anchor_s,
valid_until_system_s, max_age_s]`; `max_age_s` is the existing observation age
bound in seconds. The existing Python `native_clock_parameter` function SHALL
encode a validated binding without setting parameters or granting authority.
Root retains configuration, measured mapping and deployment ownership.

The real-hardware launch description SHALL expose this opt-in through
`FR5_REQUIRE_GRIPPER_SOURCE_CLOCK`, defaulting to `false`. Fake hardware SHALL
not receive this native parameter. Enabling it SHALL NOT create a clock binding,
change the observation age limit or authorize a robot command.

The sole native gripper worker SHALL pin that value to its current command and
hardware incarnation. Missing, malformed, expired or inconsistent clock binding
and stale initial source SHALL reject before `MoveGripper`. Completion SHALL
require a mapped source interval after command start; a cached pre-command
motion-done flag SHALL NOT resume the arm. Existing command deadline, stop/error
and supersession fences SHALL remain. Freshness SHALL be checked before and
after the resume RPC; a late result SHALL NOT clear the software stream pause.
Parameter updates SHALL NOT renew a command already in progress.

After guarded gripper completion, the existing native write method SHALL wait
for a subsequent native gripper snapshot from the read cycle and revalidate its
incarnation, generation and source/host clock freshness before streaming an arm
packet. Completion between read and write SHALL NOT bypass this condition.
The four incarnation words SHALL remain exact uint32 values in the parameter;
fractional, oversized or reordered identity words SHALL fail comparison against
the current hardware incarnation. Command generation is not encoded in this
parameter and retains its existing exact-in-double range bound.
Out-of-range gripper references SHALL reject before the native clamp when the
option is enabled. Generation-zero initialization and default scripted behavior
are unchanged; this option alone SHALL NOT authorize continuous learned output,
prove controller-start synchronization or establish coherent seven-joint
physical sampling. An SDK call already in flight cannot be undone by this check.

#### Scenario: Cached completion cannot release native arm streaming

- **WHEN** the opt-in worker receives a fresh initial sample followed by the same
  pre-command motion-done source calendar
- **THEN** no resume RPC or arm-stream release is permitted from that completion
- **AND** the existing deadline or source freshness failure terminates the wait
- **AND** a fresh post-command sample may complete only the retained generation

#### Scenario: Completion arrives between read and write

- **WHEN** the worker completes after a pending read-cycle snapshot
- **THEN** the write method waits for the next read without sending an arm packet
- **AND** a stale snapshot, wrong incarnation or expired pinned clock fails closed
- **AND** a late resume result or a later parameter update cannot renew the command

#### Scenario: Fresh receipt contains an old completion

- **WHEN** the SDK returns a pre-command completion calendar in a newly sampled
  and serialized state, even with matching target/feedback and JTC success
- **THEN** the existing executor rejects the completion and sends no next arm
- **AND** a later fresh sample does not replace the retained completion calendar
- **AND** cancellation and unresolved action ownership remain in the sole transport

#### Scenario: Hardware or command changes during a frozen slice

- **WHEN** incarnation changes, a different command supersedes the expected
  generation, or native completion remains unresolved
- **THEN** terminal/start and canonical trace consumers reject the association
- **AND** full model output, exact-plan and physical authority remain unchanged

Root retains driver deployment, measured clock mapping, actual broadcaster
availability, hardware tracking and physical qualification. CPU native-method
replay and ROS serializer tests do not discharge those requirements. Fresh
hardware gripper evidence does not prove coherent seven-joint source sampling
or synchronized controller starts; continuous references remain unsupported.

#### Scenario: JTC succeeds before native completion becomes available

- **WHEN** the successful JTC result arrives while fresh native state identifies
  the expected queued or active command without error/stop
- **THEN** the existing transport retains ownership and services native state
  callbacks under the original phase deadline and lease
- **AND** later fresh same-command completion permits exactly one next arm slice
- **AND** the canonical terminal observation retains first observed JTC success
  time separately from hardware handoff time; the recorded interval is not a
  measurement of physical completion latency or policy effectiveness

#### Scenario: Cancel or deadline interrupts a native completion wait

- **WHEN** the original deadline/lease expires or cancellation arrives during
  the wait, including inside a late snapshot callback
- **THEN** all future dispatch remains fenced and the native wait cannot restart
- **AND** a prior JTC SUCCEEDED result remains SUCCEEDED terminal evidence;
  cancellation cannot relabel it CANCELED or claim an in-flight SDK safety stop
- **AND** ordinary diagnostic polling cannot release the owned handoff early

These acceptance rules follow the shared portfolio proof-loop requirements for
native safety ownership and evidence lineage; they introduce no operator gate.
They apply to the supported finite held-target mode. They do not qualify serial
execution of arbitrary model references as preserving original 30 Hz timing,
nor supply controller-start coherence or staged-release continuous consumption.

### Requirement: Continuous-reference compatibility includes sampled commands

Any future continuous-reference consumer SHALL preserve the explicitly bound
arm and gripper interpolation semantics in addition to the original full model
knots, units and times. Serialization of identical waypoints SHALL NOT establish
equivalence between one uniform-interpolation controller and the configured mixed
arm/gripper controllers. Start compatibility SHALL account for the controller's
pre-trajectory command reference and first-sample time, including a pause before
the common future start. These are acceptance conditions for the still-unsupported
consumer, not authorization to modify controller configuration or live commands.

#### Scenario: Feedback initialization changes a held command before launch

- **WHEN** fresh feedback differs from the prior held reference by more than the
  native raw-reference enqueue deadband before a future trajectory start
- **THEN** start compatibility cannot be inferred from fresh feedback alone
- **AND** an initialization correction must preserve subsequent original model
  references and the explicitly planned staged-release targets and holds
- **AND** sampler-level compatibility does not prove native stage completion,
  synchronized physical sampling or task effect

### Requirement: Controller sampling diagnostics retain source meaning

The native snapshot and existing learned execution trace SHALL retain available
JTC diagnostics in each controller's `sample`: `joint_names`, `ros_stamp_ns`,
`reference_elapsed_ns`, `feedback_elapsed_ns`, `reference_positions`,
`feedback_positions` and `reported_output_positions`. Signed elapsed nanoseconds
SHALL preserve pre-start values; ROS publication time SHALL NOT be relabeled as
SYSTEM time. Empty reported output SHALL remain empty, and a reported value SHALL
NOT be promoted to a fresh command-interface read or hardware acknowledgement.
Malformed records or disagreement with the same snapshot's gripper
reference/feedback SHALL reject. Older snapshots and traces MAY omit diagnostics;
absence supplies no controller-start evidence.

#### Scenario: A fresh publication contains old reported output

- **WHEN** the JTC publication retains an earlier output while reference or
  publication time changes
- **THEN** the native snapshot and canonical learned trace preserve that report
  separately from reference and feedback
- **AND** matching clock fields or a reported output do not establish goal
  identity, timely first sampling, source-clock mapping or hardware completion
- **AND** existing freshness, same-command completion and cancellation checks
  remain in force without a new execution mode or controller owner

### Requirement: Native finite inference consumes original fresh observation sources

The existing finite checkpoint-to-plan entrypoint SHALL support bounded capture
of configured camera1/camera2 topics and complete seven-joint JointState on the
sole motion transport's existing node after model load. Capture SHALL subscribe
and read only, reuse the existing image conversion, preserve original header
timestamps and absolute radians/meters, and reject simulated clock operation,
missing messages, stale/future source or receipt time and unresolved motion.
It SHALL NOT start a recorder, send a goal, modify source data or confer any
physical or future-policy authority. The same child SHALL then compile the
frozen full output through the existing planner.

#### Scenario: Model load precedes fresh native capture

- **WHEN** the existing consumer is called with explicit two-camera topics and no supplied offline observation
- **THEN** canonical model admission/load finishes before the child captures new state/camera messages
- **AND** the retained original timestamps are checked before and after inference
- **AND** one child processes capture and planning, with zero goal/recorder effects

#### Scenario: A repeated publication carries stale source time

- **WHEN** callbacks arrive recently but their source headers exceed the configured observation age
- **THEN** capture fails without inference or planning
- **AND** conversion time consumes the same source freshness budget

#### Scenario: Cancellation or capture failure precedes planning

- **WHEN** cancellation occurs during model loading or native capture, or capture fails
- **THEN** no later inference or plan is accepted and any acquired child is closed
- **AND** explicit offline observations remain supported without silently starting camera capture

This observation producer does not discharge execution-time state admission,
controller start/pause coherence, staged-release consumption or physical
qualification. Generation freshness and execution freshness remain distinct
requirements; original input timestamps SHALL NOT be silently refreshed.

### Requirement: Frozen approval and current execution evidence have distinct freshness

A finite proposal SHALL retain its original observation timestamps and prove its
input-age bound at inference and plan admission. After approval, the sole
executor SHALL admit the current state against the unchanged exact plan rather
than extend the input-age budget or renew historical image timestamps. Existing
approval expiry, human/scene/cell/precontact checks, lease and cancellation
ownership SHALL remain in effect; this SHALL NOT authorize future policy outputs.

The first compiled dispatch SHALL bind the planning hardware incarnation and
command generation when measured native evidence is available. A plan without
that evidence MAY remain available for software review but SHALL fail execution
as unbound. Current admission SHALL require bounded receipt and original
JointState/controller publication ages, positive controller scaling, full
seven-joint limits/start agreement and the existing measured native hardware
clock/completion contract. A changed incarnation or superseding command SHALL
require a new plan rather than silently acquiring its authority. The native
transport SHALL recheck the captured start evidence after deserialization and
before sending. The runtime owner remains responsible for qualifying the actual
publisher clock domains; numeric timestamp agreement alone is not that proof.

Raw finite traces SHALL retain the admitted start observation; held traces SHALL
continue to retain segment starts/terminals and same-command transitions. These
are execution diagnostics, not physical task-effect or semantic success claims.

#### Scenario: Approval delay does not alter inference evidence

- **WHEN** a still-valid exact-plan approval is used after the original inference input-age budget has elapsed
- **THEN** fresh matching state from the bound incarnation/generation may pass existing execution admission
- **AND** full model output and original inference timestamps remain unchanged in the canonical evidence

#### Scenario: Fresh delivery cannot disguise stale state or another command

- **WHEN** a newly delivered snapshot has an old/future source header, paused controller, changed incarnation/generation, or invalid start state
- **THEN** the existing executor rejects before a goal send
- **AND** missing measured hardware evidence cannot be substituted with a controller tolerance result

#### Scenario: Deserialization consumes the remaining start-state budget

- **WHEN** the captured start observation becomes stale while preparing its serialized goal
- **THEN** the sole transport refuses the send even though the frozen proposal and approval still match


### Requirement: Explicit learned inputs use the normal finite run lifecycle

The normal CLI and run session SHALL accept explicit `learned_checkpoint` and
`gripper_source_clock` together, with optional `learned_device` defaulting to
`cpu`. Omitting these fields SHALL preserve deterministic behavior and the CLI's
plan-only default. Their presence SHALL NOT grant GPU assignment, physical,
semantic, training or future-output authority. Incompatible campaign/proxy or
postcommit reposition authority SHALL reject before child/resource effects.

The existing canonical loader SHALL own checkpoint/processor admission. The
consumer SHALL match the admitted recipe's camera rename mapping to the current
validated collection profile, use its camera topics/FPS and the bound job
instruction, and supply raw RGB to the existing saved processing path without
applying observation-view transformations twice. Requested checkpoint path,
device, measured clock binding, camera mapping/topics and FPS SHALL be retained
in the exact proposal digest. File presence alone SHALL NOT establish freshness;
execution SHALL require the same bound clock mapping and existing fresh native
evidence.

Model load and camera readiness SHALL precede original observation capture. One
existing motion child SHALL own capture, compilation and any subsequently
approved execution, with existing cleanup, lease, cancellation and recorder
boundaries. Plan-only SHALL neither begin recording nor send goals. Learned
preapproval evidence SHALL retain the source program as qualification context
and set scripted trajectory-variant binding/digest to null; it SHALL NOT label
learned actions as DIRECT or TWO_STAGE execution. A finite chunk SHALL retain
unknown task effectiveness and SHALL NOT inherit scripted reset/commit semantics.

#### Scenario: A normal learned live request reaches exact approval

- **WHEN** an explicit admitted learned request passes recipe/profile and native state checks
- **THEN** the normal session freezes full seven-dimensional output using its existing child
- **AND** exact-plan approval precedes recorder begin and execution through the sole owner
- **AND** technical completion alone does not commit a training episode or prove task success

#### Scenario: Artifact preparation is outside the original input-age budget

- **WHEN** the normal caller prepares a loaded native model before fresh capture
- **THEN** the adapter reserves its existing inference lock and rechecks checkpoint bytes before capture
- **AND** a single thread-bound call consumes the owned loaded tensors without hashing the checkpoint again in the capture-to-action interval
- **AND** duplicate, reentrant or escaped prepared calls fail; cancellation/failure releases the scope

Saved CPU processor tensor storage SHALL be detached from file-backed mappings
at load before the final artifact digest check. The installed native model load
copies weights into allocated model parameters. Prepared inference binds that
loaded state, not a claim that checkpoint files cannot change: in-place file
changes after preparation SHALL NOT change this call's loaded weights or
normalization; the next preparation SHALL reject changed bytes. Direct adapter
calls SHALL retain preparation/check behavior. This does not authorize arbitrary
Python mutation of a loaded policy or change canonical normalization policy.

The unchanged original source-age budget includes native-resolution RGB
conversion, JSON transfer, inference and plan admission. Removing the full-file
hash from that interval is a software correction, not a measured runtime fit;
actual timing and physical continuous-reference consumption remain separately
qualified by their existing owners.


### Requirement: Native cold initialization precedes execution-intended capture

The normal explicit learned caller SHALL complete one discarded native warmup
on the same loaded policy and saved processors before creating its motion child
or capturing execution-intended observations. Warmup SHALL use synthetic zero
state and RGB at the validated collection dimensions with the bound instruction;
it SHALL NOT reuse those synthetic values as a proposal or receive physical,
semantic or training authority. Its output SHALL be discarded without selecting,
snapping or truncating future model output.

The existing inference owner SHALL reserve the model through warmup and cleanup,
restore Python/NumPy and Torch CPU/assigned-device RNG state, reset model/processor
queues, and reject cancellation or failure before fresh capture. Device warmup
SHALL NOT choose or acquire an unassigned GPU. Normal runtime provenance SHALL
retain its synthetic-input kind, image shape, instruction digest, assigned
device, one model call, discarded disposition and separate total/inference
wall times. Warmup timing SHALL NOT be relabeled as execution inference timing.
Historical/offline proposals MAY lack this preparation record; its presence is
not physical qualification or a guarantee that future input paths meet latency.

#### Scenario: Cold call exceeds the unchanged source-age budget

- **WHEN** first-call model/device work takes longer than the allowed age of a live observation
- **THEN** the normal caller performs that discarded work before acquiring the fresh observations used for the actual proposal
- **AND** the first proposal still passes all original pre/post-inference and plan-admission freshness checks without extending their budget
- **AND** its RNG stream is the same as if discarded warmup had not consumed random values

#### Scenario: Warmup fails or cancellation arrives during warmup

- **WHEN** warmup raises or completes after cancellation
- **THEN** no motion child, fresh capture, approval, recorder or later proposal is started
- **AND** the existing inference lock and random state are restored on the failure path

One shape-matched warmup addresses observed first-call initialization; it does not
prove native-resolution latency across all inputs, controller coherence, full
row consumption, staged-release completion, task success or data utility.


### Requirement: A learned chunk boundary retains the task and recording owner

New finite learned programs SHALL bind `LEARNED_CHUNK_COMPLETE` as their
post-action boundary. Successful controller/terminal checks SHALL enter that
nonterminal state under the existing executor and lease; OneJob SHALL keep its
same recorder transaction recording until an explicit terminal review or abort.
Chunk completion SHALL NOT set a task verdict, release the cell, commit an
episode, or authorize replay or another policy output.
The existing command cache SHALL retain at most one observation image body,
only within that capture's retry window. A distinct request, fault or close
SHALL retire that body while retaining its operation identity; retrying a retired
operation SHALL fail without recapture, and conflicting content SHALL retain the
existing operation-conflict rejection. A still-cached retry SHALL satisfy both
original source age and independent monotonic elapsed age, and command retries
SHALL NOT bypass existing executor lease/deadline checks. OneJob SHALL return
images to the observation caller while excluding them from canonical execution
response/evidence and subsequent plan/approval history; the caller owns their
bounded processing lifetime.
 Previously frozen programs
with `SEMANTIC_VERDICT` SHALL remain valid with their original boundary behavior;
validation SHALL NOT rewrite their approved programs.

At the new boundary the existing observation command MAY accept the current
run, exact plan and lease binding. It SHALL reject before capture if the owner
is elsewhere, the binding differs, or an active/unresolved goal remains.
Capture SHALL reuse the native state/image serializers, original source stamps
and admitted camera mapping and SHALL NOT relax the original observation-age
budget. After capture the owner SHALL reject cancellation, expired lease or
boundary deadline, and stale/future source timestamps. Observations SHALL NOT
renew those deadlines or stand in for motion admission, hardware incarnation
validation, completed gripper commands, or controller-start coherence. Subsequent
inference and planning retain their own original freshness and hardware checks.

The normal caller SHALL use the existing human review authority when explicitly
ending this finite probe, with its actual recording state in the bound checkpoint
evidence and an explicit statement that review does not qualify task success or
dataset commit. The existing decision evidence SHALL retain
`review_scope=FINITE_LEARNED_CHUNK`, and the run SHALL NOT promote that decision
to the task-level human semantic outcome. Only this terminal choice freezes the recorder. Pending reset
safety SHALL still prevent dataset commit. Repeated planning/execution remains
unsupported until the same task can retain each plan, approval, complete output
and terminal/intervention evidence through existing canonical consumers; no
future output inherits an earlier exact-plan approval.

#### Scenario: Completed chunk remains available for a fresh observation

- **WHEN** the sole executor completes the finite chunk and its existing terminal checks pass
- **THEN** OneJob retains the same recorder transaction and lease at `LEARNED_CHUNK_COMPLETE`
- **AND** a correctly bound native observation request returns original-stamped state and images without sending another goal or changing the frozen plan
- **AND** replay and replacement planning remain rejected until their distinct contracts are implemented and approved

#### Scenario: Observation finishes after cancellation or its allowed wait

- **WHEN** a bound capture returns after cancellation, lease expiry or the existing semantic-wait deadline
- **THEN** the late observation is rejected and the existing abort/cancellation owner retains responsibility
- **AND** recording is aborted without commit, another goal or automatic deadline renewal

Runnable CPU replay, including actual ROS serializers and the normal operator
checkpoint consumer, requires no ROS node, GPU, model download or physical data:

```sh
direnv exec . python3 -m unittest tests.data_factory.rollout.test_finite_plan tests.data_factory.rollout.test_policy_observation tests.data_factory.test_one_job tests.data_factory.test_run_job
```

### Requirement: A pending chunk preserves the current task authority

The sole executor and OneJob SHALL prepare a subsequent learned candidate only
at `LEARNED_CHUNK_COMPLETE`, with the same run, live lease, recording transaction,
source program, checkpoint and inference/runtime binding. Preparation SHALL NOT
replace the current plan or approve or send the candidate. Source and monotonic
freshness SHALL be checked after compilation; late, reentrant or cancelled work
SHALL NOT revive the attempt. Only one pending candidate is retained.

A candidate SHALL require its own explicit exact-plan human approval and the
existing precontact confirmation. Activation SHALL preserve the blocked cell's
current run/plan binding, unchanged scene snapshot and sole motion owner, and
validate current native start evidence against both the candidate and previous
chunk's terminal observation. Cell ownership transfer SHALL compare the full
previously checked state under the existing store lock before writing; an
intervening binding or acknowledgment SHALL remain unchanged, including during
continuation abort handling. Unresolved goals, paused/stale state, changed
hardware incarnation/generation or cell/scene binding SHALL prevent activation.
Preparation and activation SHALL NOT grant unseen-output authority.

Before switching plans, existing execution evidence SHALL retain the previous
plan envelope, exact approval and validated trace, with the complete prior record
bound into the next plan's predecessor digest. One recorder and global phase sequence SHALL continue.
Existing report and diagnostic consumers SHALL validate and retain that history;
missing or reordered history SHALL NOT yield a qualified diagnostic. Initial
redundant held gripper segments SHALL use the existing preapproval omission and
same-command evidence; original model actions remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: A completed close reference continues into a new arm chunk

- **WHEN** the native serializer/transport replay reports close reference
  0.01176 m and bound feedback 0.01218 m, then prepares and exactly approves
  a new chunk that retains the close reference
- **THEN** existing planning omits the redundant first gripper segment
- **AND** all new arm rows reach the same transport without another gripper goal
- **AND** fresh start and terminal evidence remains linked to the prior command
- **AND** one recorder transaction and lease continue through both chunks

#### Scenario: Pending work loses freshness or ownership

- **WHEN** compilation outlives source or monotonic freshness, reenters the
  executor, or the next start observes cancellation, a foreign cell binding,
  changed incarnation/generation or a paused controller
- **THEN** no subsequent goal is sent and the old exact plan is not silently replaced
- **AND** the existing stop/abort owner retains the failure

#### Scenario: The supervised attempt ends without qualified reset evidence

- **WHEN** the operator ends the finite chunk sequence
- **THEN** existing recorder freeze and terminal safety checks remain authoritative
- **AND** the diagnostic retains previous exact plans and approvals
- **AND** absent reset safety prevents commit and task effectiveness remains UNKNOWN

This controlled per-chunk test path is an intermediate software capability.
It does not satisfy autonomous bounded-task usability or whole-task success,
and it does not prove continuous raw-reference consumption on the physical FR5.

### Requirement: Existing scene update evidence remains in the execution result

When learned terminal handling or non-release failure successfully updates an
object to UNKNOWN through the existing SceneStateStore, the executor SHALL retain
the returned snapshot in its existing `scene_transition` evidence field. That
snapshot's revision, object evidence and canonical digest describe the update at
that time; subsequent scene changes SHALL NOT rewrite the historical result.
The initial plan's scene binding remains unchanged. Revision conflicts or failed
writes SHALL NOT manufacture a successful transition snapshot.

#### Scenario: A later scene update follows a learned attempt

- **WHEN** terminal handling or failure records an UNKNOWN object snapshot and
  the existing scene owner later records another supported object state
- **THEN** OneJob's execution result retains the original UNKNOWN snapshot and digest
- **AND** current scene lookup returns the newer revision separately
- **AND** neither snapshot retention nor command completion grants landing,
  semantic success, reset safety, recorder commit or training authority

### Requirement: Learned dispatch serializes bound Scene validation and submission

The existing motion owner SHALL hold the existing Scene store lock from bound
revision, digest and object validation through learned goal submission. This
applies after initial and next-chunk confirmation, not only when a plan is
prepared. A changed Scene SHALL reject the new goal without replacing the foreign
Scene state. A writer arriving during validation SHALL serialize after submission.

Cancellation and deadline checks SHALL remain effective before submission.
The original absolute lease and applicable confirmation deadline SHALL reach the
actual native send after compilation, deserialization and evidence checks; work
inside that interval SHALL NOT renew either deadline. Learned Scene acquisition
and fault writes SHALL fail promptly with distinct `SCENE_STATE_BUSY` on lock
contention, retaining the foreign state and zero new sends. Legacy Collection
locking SHALL retain its existing default behavior.
Reentrant fault handling SHALL set the existing cancellation event immediately
and defer Scene-writing fault work until the lock is released. Cancellation after
submission SHALL cancel that owned goal; it SHALL NOT be reported as zero sends.
This ordering adds no Scene store, execution owner or task-success authority.

#### Scenario: Scene changes while awaiting next-chunk confirmation

- **WHEN** another owner changes the bound Scene before the approved next chunk is confirmed
- **THEN** confirmation rejects with no new transport goal
- **AND** the other owner's Scene state remains unchanged by rejection handling

#### Scenario: Cancellation arrives inside learned dispatch

- **WHEN** a callback requests cancellation during locked validation or submission
- **THEN** the cancellation event is set immediately without nested Scene locking
- **AND** fault cleanup completes after unlock, cancelling only an already issued owned goal

#### Scenario: Preparation outlives the original dispatch deadline

- **WHEN** initial or next-chunk compilation, decoding or evidence checks exceed the original lease or confirmation deadline
- **THEN** the native transport submits zero new goals and releases its unused active handle
- **AND** concurrent heartbeat updates do not extend that in-flight dispatch deadline

#### Scenario: A foreign owner retains the Scene lock

- **WHEN** learned confirmation or fault cleanup encounters a held Scene lock
- **THEN** it returns the distinct contention result without waiting for the foreign holder to release it
- **AND** the foreign Scene bytes and legacy Collection locking behavior remain unchanged

### Requirement: Current source freshness is independent of retained command completion

The existing `require_gripper_source_clock=true` deployment opt-in SHALL select
native evidence version 3. Its existing gripper worker SHALL bracket an exact
native sampled frame with two precise read-only controller-clock queries outside
real-time read/write and gripper mutex ownership. The source calendar interval,
including millisecond encoding ambiguity, SHALL be strictly enclosed by those
queries. Freshness SHALL use the worst-case HOST query-start age under the
existing selected age budget, not a controller delta or future drift estimate.
The certificate SHALL bind incarnation, generation, calendar, frame and original
native SYSTEM/STEADY read times. Re-publication SHALL NOT refresh those times.

The worker SHALL service current evidence through idle arm writes and stop with
its hardware lifecycle. Query failure, clock regression, an expired certificate,
read failure, stop/error or changed incarnation/generation SHALL prevent further
arm transmission. A current certificate SHALL NOT establish command completion.

Live command evidence SHALL use the exact certified native state, including
position, motion-done and fault fields, rather than a separate cached-state read.
After a successful non-blocking MoveGripper return, the sole worker SHALL record
paired host acknowledgement anchors. Eligible command samples SHALL be strictly
enclosed by queries whose first HOST start is no earlier than that acknowledgement.
This establishes post-return sample timing, not a device command-ID acknowledgement,
queue flush, grasp success or whole-task success.

The original command deadline, advancing-source and activity/target predicates
SHALL remain enforced. The terminal decision SHALL freeze its own exact
calendar/frame/read anchors, query bracket, raw status, reference, generation,
incarnation and validation instant. That terminal bracket SHALL satisfy the same
age bound before servo restart and final completion commitment. A renewed CURRENT
certificate SHALL NOT replace terminal proof, revive an incomplete/expired command
or change frozen inference, plan or trace provenance. Native release and Python
consumers SHALL validate historical proof at its recorded instant; an immediate
completion handoff SHALL additionally reject an aged terminal bracket.

The existing LIVE preparation owner SHALL explicitly select version 3 and set/read
back `gripper_temporal_policy_v1` on the existing hardware node. Its seven numeric
values SHALL be `[1, incarnation_0, incarnation_1, incarnation_2, incarnation_3,
max_age_s, host_clock_tolerance_s]`, from `fr5.gripper_temporal_policy.v1`.
The native worker SHALL pin the policy for its activation; changes require a new
activation and incarnation. This policy SHALL NOT contain an offset, inferred rate
or expiry horizon and SHALL NOT expand the selected age or host-clock tolerance.
Plan-only SHALL only observe. Missing/mismatched policy, native version,
incarnation or parameter readback SHALL block live consumption. Bootstrap and
normal caller integration require their own verification; the native wire and
reader alone SHALL NOT be reported as a qualified live path.

The normal runner and motion child SHALL preserve an explicitly selected
`gripper_temporal_policy` input end to end, mutually exclusive with the legacy
`gripper_source_clock` input. The frozen proposal SHALL bind that exact policy
and hardware wire version 3. Identity-only bootstrap decoding or successful
parameter readback SHALL NOT substitute for fresh qualified version 3 evidence.

Archived version 1 and 2 evidence SHALL retain its original mapping/proof reader
semantics without automatic promotion to live evidence. A newly approved live
plan SHALL explicitly identify its temporal policy and wire version; existing
approved plans and stored artifacts SHALL NOT be rewritten for compatibility.

Controller clock/status-domain continuity, reset detection, busy-controller
query latency and device queue attribution remain root-owned physical
qualification. The precise read-only RPC and CPU tests SHALL NOT be interpreted
as proof of those properties or permission for physical execution.

#### Scenario: Initial and subsequent commands outlive an old offset mapping

- **WHEN** idle or approval delay exceeds a historical offset mapping, or its horizon would expire during a command
- **THEN** a new version 3 command may establish completion using fresh exact post-acknowledgement certified samples under the unchanged live policy
- **AND** no offset horizon is extended and no stale/incomplete command is repaired

#### Scenario: Completed proof remains historical during current renewal

- **WHEN** current evidence is renewed after a causal terminal record was established
- **THEN** the terminal tuple, acknowledgement and proof instant remain unchanged
- **AND** stale current evidence, changed generation/incarnation, fault, stop or regression blocks arm transmission

#### Scenario: A different or pre-acknowledgement frame is offered as completion

- **WHEN** a sample differs from the certified native state, precedes the acknowledgement query, touches a quantization boundary or expires before commitment
- **THEN** it cannot establish completion or release the arm
- **AND** cancellation and the original command deadline remain bounded through the existing worker

#### Scenario: A current frame contains an old off-target done flag

- **WHEN** unchanged off-target feedback reports done after command acknowledgment
- **THEN** that flag alone SHALL NOT complete the native command
- **AND** fresh done within the existing one-percent native feedback tick of the quantized requested target remains admissible, while off-target completion requires witnessed post-acknowledgment busy-to-done or plausible observed movement followed by the existing stable-away dwell across valid advancing samples
- **AND** stable-away completion remains mechanical evidence, not grasp, release or task success
