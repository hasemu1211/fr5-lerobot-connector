Session transition: see [handoff.md](handoff.md) for the 2026-09-09 candidate,
live regression handle and unqualified physical boundary. Revalidate its runtime
observations; this pointer does not mark the unfinished tasks below complete.

## Native processor readiness

- [x] Reproduce a loader-admitted state normalization bypass with installed saved processors and synthetic CPU inputs.
- [x] Reject incompatible state/action declarations and state filters at the existing native loader boundary.
- [x] Reject inline statistics that supersede validated saved tensors.
- [x] Verify rejection before model loading and preserve valid saved-processor behavior with focused tests.
- [x] Consolidate saved-artifact validation in Learning's canonical validator and verify native failure propagation before model loading.

## Native runtime ownership

- [x] Reproduce overlapping inference through separate finite consumers sharing one loaded policy.
- [x] Reject the competing consumer before shared model/processor reset and preserve sequential reuse after success or failure.

## Execution architecture qualification

- [x] Characterize native RPC-budget rejection without commands and falsify single-acquisition success as proof of continuous certificate renewal; retain the distinction from physical measurements in `design.md`.
- [ ] Qualify sustainable feedback certification and fault propagation, comparing total-budget correction with responsibility/scheduling correction before deployment; preserve source identity, original freshness and motion authority.
- [ ] Compare the installed LeRobot rollout/Robot seam against the current full-chunk consumer, including transformed/sent evidence and teardown ownership; adopt upstream functionality where total integration and maintenance cost is lower.

This bounded outcome preserves the continuing Rollout Goal. Actual
checkpoint admission, resource assignment, physical qualification and
condition-level task-effect/data-utility evidence remain separate outcomes.

## Offline latency and action fidelity

- [x] Independently reproduce remaining-horizon midpoint behavior on a time-linear CPU field and compare its exact ODE endpoint separately from native Euler reference.
- [x] Add a three-step local midpoint control with six counted expert evaluations to the existing offline native consumer, preserving saved processors and model ownership.
- [x] Verify paired inputs, actual installed sampling consumption and analytic counterexamples with focused CPU tests.
- [x] Record the competing async path, bounded cost, falsifier and Learning/root handoff in this change.
- [x] Consume an immutable admitted trained checkpoint and Learning-selected observation scope after root resource assignment.
- [ ] Compare warmed chunk cost, per-joint action deviation and peak memory; revise the candidate using measured tradeoffs before any deployed change.
- [ ] Connect any later authorized runtime change to actual lifecycle traces and task/data-utility evidence; numerical results alone do not finish this outcome.

## Finite held-target consumption

- [x] Verify the opt-in serialized-reference caller with stored unchanged 4032
  rows, per-row retiming, explicit integer-percent alternative, ordered native
  goals and retained raw/proposed/terminal provenance.
- [ ] Integrate the serialized-reference schema into the existing Quality phase
  event consumer without changing its plan/segment identity rules (root-owned).
- [ ] Preserve the root-owned terminal lifecycle source retention in the normal
  caller when integrating reference options, so Curator can rederive diagnostics
  from the existing run evidence rather than trust a detached projection.
- [ ] Qualify total native wait and goal overhead against the unchanged five-second
  chunk bound before claiming practical physical playback; retain the controller
  start/sampling and whole-task effectiveness limitations below.

- [x] Distinguish controller-reference targets from observed feedback using native source and primary controller documentation.
- [x] Add explicit bound held-target proposals consumed by existing OneJob, sole executor and ROS transport without modifying approved arm commands.
- [x] Expose the default-false held-target option through the native checkpoint-to-plan entrypoint, verified with saved processors and the existing planner consumer.
- [x] Retain fresh start/terminal observations in the canonical learned trace, preserving failure, cancellation and data-admission boundaries.
- [x] Replay held completion and failure cases with synthetic clients and actual ROS serializers; check limits, delayed snapshot, cancellation and collision samples.
- [x] Preserve distinct, exact-plan-bound subsegment identities through the existing event writer/validator and report/phase/joint/interaction consumers; verify [1,2,3] rows join exactly 6 and gripper windows are excluded from arm metrics.
- [ ] Root integrates the scoped change and reviews the exact plan before any separately authorized physical baseline.
- [ ] Establish actual FR5 target tracking, task effect and safe-reset evidence; CPU replay does not discharge physical qualification or continuing data-utility ownership.

Runnable CPU check (no ROS node, model, GPU, original dataset or robot effects):

```

## Continuous model references: consumer compatibility

- [x] Distinguish hardware integer resolution from its raw-reference enqueue deadband using the actual source and a CPU-extracted predicate replay.
- [x] Compare timed seven-joint execution against serial exact references; retain their timing, completion and staged-source limitations.
- [x] Verify through existing finite inference and OneJob that continuous in-limit output and staged source reject without input rewriting or executor/recorder effects.
- [x] Prepare an unapplied, exact-source-bound hardware patch for same-generation completion, coherent read-cycle evidence and native-time gating; verify copied driver methods with the installed sampler on CPU.
- [x] Reject paused-controller observations through held execution and canonical trace consumers; replay the existing wall-time timeout and sole cancellation owner with frozen controller time.
- [x] Falsify equal scaling as start synchronization and unscoped generation/time as sufficient identity; retain activation generation zero as observation only.
- [x] Correct the isolated worker's known stop/error and supersession fence before MoveGripper; preserve original patch evidence and the in-flight cancellation limitation.
- [x] Bind held-target evidence to hardware incarnation, command generation, explicit bounded source-clock mapping and independent monotonic freshness in existing native transport/executor/trace consumers.
- [x] Prepare tracked native export/known-stop patch and verify actual extracted C++ methods plus ROS serializers on CPU, including stale completion, supersession and paused-time rejection.
- [ ] Root deploys the exact driver residual and measures the same-incarnation source clock mapping; verify actual DynamicJointState export before physical consumption.
- [ ] Prove controller-start coherence and coherent seven-joint physical sampling; held-target metadata does not discharge these continuous-consumer requirements.
- [x] Retain successful JTC terminal evidence while waiting for fresh expected native completion under the same owner and original phase deadline; verify later completion, queued callbacks, cancel/lease/deadline and late-snapshot fences on CPU.
- [x] Compare unified-controller interpolation with the configured mixed native samplers using actual serialized proposals; preserve the counterexamples to identical-waypoint equivalence and common-header start coherence.
- [x] Exercise prior-command versus feedback initialization and immediate staged-release sampling with the installed native sampler; distinguish sample compatibility from completed hardware stages.
- [x] Retain native JTC source/trajectory clocks and literal reported command output through existing snapshot and learned trace consumers; verify signed durations, unavailable/old output and malformed-record rejection with actual ROS serializers.
- [x] Prepare opt-in post-command source freshness at the native worker/read-cycle release owner, using the existing measured binding and framework hardware node; verify cached/fresh, expired/rebound, incarnation, stop/error and late-resume cases with actual extracted worker/write methods and ROS serializers.
- [ ] Root verifies real same-command hardware completion/arm resume and clock mapping after driver integration; JTC tolerance and CPU replay alone remain insufficient.
- [ ] Implement an explicitly bounded native continuous-reference consumer with original full output, consumed indices and staged-release compatibility retained; do not automatically truncate or snap.
- [ ] Verify its normal executor/trace consumers and failure/cancellation before any separately assigned physical qualification.

Focused CPU acceptance (the vendor predicate replay is separate analytical
source evidence, not a simulated complete hardware execution):

```sh
direnv exec . python3 -m unittest tests.data_factory.rollout.test_finite_plan --durations 5
```

Focused held hardware evidence acceptance (CPU only; no driver installation):

```sh
direnv exec . python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/data_factory/rollout
direnv exec . python3 -m unittest tests.data_factory.test_motion_transport_execution tests.data_factory.test_motion
```

## Native observation-to-plan bridge

- [x] Add bounded source-stamped state and two-camera capture to the sole motion child's existing protocol, reusing the recorder's image conversion and retaining absolute seven-joint feedback.
- [x] Consume native capture after admitted model load through `run_learned_plan_only`, reusing that child for exact-plan compilation; preserve the supplied offline-observation path.
- [x] Verify actual ROS serializers, stale/paused/future source rejection, missing input, cancellation and saved-processor-to-plan consumption without goals or recorder effects.
- [x] Separate immutable inference input-age evidence from fresh execution-state admission across approval delay; retain original input stamps and require the planning hardware incarnation/generation at initial dispatch.
- [ ] Connect the resulting exact-plan consumer to current source-clock deployment and continuous seven-joint controller timing before physical execution; no future output inherits its approval.

Focused native capture/consumer checks:

```sh
direnv exec . python3 -m unittest tests.data_factory.rollout.test_policy_observation tests.data_factory.rollout.test_native_policy tests.data_factory.test_run_job.RunJobTest.test_native_observation_failure_and_cancellation_close_the_same_child
```

## Frozen-plan execution freshness

- [x] Preserve inference/plan-admission source-age checks while replacing post-approval input-age reuse with current full-state/controller/hardware admission.
- [x] Bind the first dispatch to the planning hardware incarnation/generation; leave offline plans without that evidence reviewable but non-executable.
- [x] Retain original JointState/JTC stamps and validate freshness again after native goal deserialization; reject stale, paused, rebound, superseded or out-of-limit state without sends.
- [x] Retain the raw chunk's start observation in the existing canonical trace and preserve held-command completion/transition validation; reject pre-send state failures before activation and consult native goal ownership before cancellation.
- [x] Forward the existing measured clock file through the native planner factory; verify delayed-approval replay, failure/cancel and actual ROS serializers on CPU.
- [ ] Root verifies the deployed publisher clock domains and measured hardware binding; CPU fixtures do not qualify the physical graph.
- [x] Connect explicit learned inputs through the normal CLI/session plan-only and live callers, preserving one child, exact approval and honest finite-probe provenance.
- [x] Bind requested checkpoint/device, measured clock mapping, recipe/profile camera mapping and rate into the exact proposal; reject incompatible scope or changed mapping before effects.
- [x] Move checkpoint revalidation before fresh capture under one reserved inference scope; isolate saved CPU processor storage and test same-inode file mutation with actual native loading primitives.
- [x] Complete a discarded, shape-matched native warmup before the normal caller creates its child or captures fresh inputs; preserve random state, cleanup and separate preparation timing.
- [ ] Qualify native-resolution conversion/transfer/inference/plan admission against the unchanged 0.3-second budget on root-assigned runtime resources; synthetic small images and model seams do not establish usability.
- [ ] Close continuous start/pause/full-row/staged-release consumption under the existing executor and authority owners.

## Complete learned task attempt (direction accepted; native qualification pending)

Priority for the open items below is the smallest real Pick loop: existing
collected data and trained checkpoint → bounded learned Pick → qualified
mechanical release/reset → retained success/failure diagnosis → actual targeted
recollection. Authority, handoff and failure-evidence preservation are enabling
work for that outcome, not separate completion claims. Independent safe work may
proceed in parallel; this priority does not impose a serial implementation order.
Broader framework migration or interface generalization is not a prerequisite.

- [x] Distinguish new finite chunk completion from task review in the native executor and normal caller; retain one recording transaction and lease until explicit terminal review/abort, preserving previously frozen programs.
- [x] Consume a run/plan/lease-bound fresh observation at that boundary through OneJob and the native serializers; reject active ownership, stale/late/cancelled observations and unchanged plan replay without new sends.
- [x] Bound native capture-image cache lifetime and keep image bodies out of canonical execution evidence; preserve operation conflicts, reject stale/retired replay and retain lease enforcement on retries.
- [x] Retain successful UNKNOWN scene updates in existing execution evidence for learned terminal/non-release failure; verify historical snapshot retention and unchanged conflict/write-failure behavior with the actual temporary scene store.
- [x] Preserve repeated chunk identities in shared phase streams through explicit exact-plan lookup and per-plan existing quality attributes/reports; reject malformed/cross-run/replayed bindings and prevent cross-plan terminal or row aliasing.
- [x] Retain prior exact plan envelopes, approvals and validated traces through same-run pending-candidate planning and explicitly approved replacement; preserve one lease/recorder, native start/terminal checks and existing report/diagnostic consumers.
- [ ] Connect native inference and pending-candidate preview to the normal task interaction loop without claiming per-chunk approval as autonomous task usability; resolve the bounded future-output authority and physical producer contracts first.

- [x] Resolve user intent: system-consumed bounded authority covers learned Pick plus qualified mechanical placement/reset; no additional personal grasp gate or learned Place prerequisite. This decision is not runtime qualification.
- [x] Implement native bounded-attempt authority through the existing OneJob owner, with exact generated-plan admission and unchanged task deadline, rather than repeated human chunk approval. Preserve inference/plan input-age checks separately from current execution-state admission through recorder preparation and held-segment completion; physical qualification remains below.
- [ ] Connect learned Pick to existing qualified mechanical placement/reset from current measured state; validate handoff/contact/illumination scope and preserve separate control-source, Scene and recorder evidence through the normal diagnostic/recollection consumers.
- [x] Implement restricted prospective continuous-reference coverage and predecessor-bound carried-envelope continuity in the sole executor, with explicit native v4 selected-command evidence and unchanged archived v1/v2/v3 readers, policy rows, generations and staged release timing.
- [x] Exercise the real contact producer and native serializers with explicit simulated geometry/hardware, retained stored 8000-step checkpoint outputs, supported continuation and rejected coverage/tuple/contact evolution. These tests establish software behavior only; the three buildable stored programs are not claimed as successful physical Picks.
- [x] Integrate exact v4 runtime-input production and protocol admission through the normal caller, then independently review the combined producer/consumer path. Preserve exact v3 approvals rather than treating protocol pins as minimum versions.
- [ ] Physically qualify the candidate aperture/contact geometry and actual runtime environment; retain unavailable live paths until real qualification exists. Demonstrate physical release and original-condition next-Collection consumption separately from model-based envelope feasibility.
- [x] Connect stopped learned-run failure/cancellation to transaction-bound native recorder retention and the existing lifecycle diagnostic. Verify temporary RGB/state/action persistence, stop-before-retain ordering, uncertain-cancel/response preservation, unchanged Collection abort/commit and independent training authority.
- [x] Release live-owned transaction staging only after complete native diagnostic publication and source/ownership verification; verify the next native recorder begin, retained committed bytes and no new historical payload reads at normal startup. Partial, uncertain and orphan-quarantined saves remain explicitly unresolved.
- [ ] Verify original-condition next-Collection consumption through the canonical diagnostic, qualified mechanical terminal and Scene owners without semantic PASS fabrication, source-data mutation or a second recorder.
- [ ] Compare synchronous same-owner continuation against supervised exact-approved chunks, retaining intervention, total task duration and native gripper/start/prefix evidence.
- [ ] Demonstrate attributable complete-task success/failure and diagnostic linkage; finite prefix completion, solver metrics and synthetic replay do not satisfy this outcome.
- [ ] Conditionally adopt a minimal upstream/commercial-tool adapter when a concrete consumer or measured bottleneck justifies it and implementation plus maintenance cost is lower than duplicating the capability. Reuse existing owners and contracts; bring this forward only when it directly enables the Pick loop or removes evidenced recurring work. Otherwise leave it open, without committing to a new framework, product layer or interface family.
- [x] Resolve replacement intent: keep existing controller/state/action coordinates, original data/checkpoints and historical qualification immutable; reuse the native model-selection and exact-binding interfaces instead of per-consumer inversions.
- [ ] Verify the smallest geometry-only replacement against unchanged arm/action semantics and historical data/checkpoint consumption, preserve the original model/configuration, and qualify the replacement before switching the active execution model. Model arithmetic alone is not physical contact evidence.
