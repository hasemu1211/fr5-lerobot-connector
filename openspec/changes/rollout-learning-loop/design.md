# Execution ownership and temporal qualification

## Outcome and decision status

The target remains a real learned Pick, qualified mechanical release, attributable
diagnosis and targeted recollection. A successful clock query, CPU replay or
framework adapter is not that outcome. Optimize total implementation, recurring
debugging and operating cost, not changed-line count. Runtime adoption remains
pending; the characterization tests below do not change a deployed threshold.

## Reuse boundary

LeRobot owns policy implementation, saved processors and supported inference
mechanisms. FR5 already calls `SmolVLAPolicy.from_pretrained`, saved native
processors and `predict_action_chunk` in `learned_action_adapter.py`. Do not
reimplement these capabilities or add a competing generic rollout framework.

The installed LeRobot 0.6.1 also has `Robot.get_observation/send_action`,
`rollout/inference/`, and `lerobot-rollout`. Its `SyncInferenceEngine.get_action`
returns one action via `select_action`; `strategies/core.send_next_action`
interpolates/processes that action, calls the robot, and returns the pre-robot
action dictionary rather than the robot's returned actual action. The default
teardown can issue interpolated return-to-initial commands. These are observed
local interface semantics, not a claim that upstream cannot support FR5.

Prefer a supported LeRobot interface when its adapter removes more owned code
and recurring work than it introduces. Compare at the actual seam: preserve
full model output and consumed indices for trajectory admission, distinguish
proposed/processed/sent/measured actions, and route normal motion and teardown
through the same FR5 execution authority. A per-row adapter must not acknowledge
buffered rows as physically executed, bypass collision admission, or introduce
a second device/recorder owner. No dependency upgrade or whole-runner replacement
is justified solely by the presence of a CLI.

Local installed source remains the integration authority; documentation can
describe a different revision.

## Responsibilities to retain or repair

Apply requirements at the action that consumes them. Reuse static qualification
within its source/model/configuration scope; reopen it only for relevant changes
or counterevidence. Recheck mutable scene, cell, ownership and freshness at their
existing consumption boundaries. Do not make later training utility or whole-task
success a prerequisite for a bounded hardware diagnostic. An implementation's
chosen timeout is revisable engineering policy, not automatically a physical
safety invariant.

The approved product domain and existing SceneStateStore/scene/cell contracts
govern the environment assumptions. Do not add coordinator visual approval,
per-attempt person-absence approval, or a new perception gate. Existing mapped
illumination checks belong in the system execution path; an agent's preview is
diagnostic assistance, not runtime authority. This does not claim that the scene
store detects arbitrary people or unregistered obstacles.

- Policy proposes actions; it neither approves collision safety nor sends SDK
  commands. Admission validates the proposed motion against current state,
  registered geometry and selected limits. The sole executor owns dispatch,
  cancellation and qualified mechanical release.
- Collision checking currently samples knots and four intermediate states per
  interval. It is not a continuous collision proof or a model of unregistered
  obstacles. Grasp contact and carried geometry require their existing bindings.
- Native feedback acquisition owns source/receipt timestamps and clock-query
  validity. Completion evidence remains command/incarnation-specific. Neither
  network response time nor a held reference establishes physical completion.
- Observation quality, execution-state freshness, RPC waiting and total command
  duration are different contracts. Do not infer a hardware safety limit from
  camera FPS or silently reuse one numeric bound as another authority.

## Minimum sufficient execution evidence

The next opt-in adapter shall separate coherent state delivery, command completion
and cross-clock alignment quality. This is a successor contract, not permission
to reinterpret or bypass the deployed version 3/4 certificate reader.

Current-state delivery must preserve one complete native frame, its original host
receipt time, publication sequence and connection/configuration identity. A getter
or ROS republish cannot renew that receipt. Missing/expired delivery, a changed
connection, regressing source state, device faults and unresolved motion ownership
remain execution concerns. A recent receipt alone does not establish physical
acquisition age or rule out a buffered TCP backlog; those limitations must remain
explicit in qualification, not hidden behind a `source_timestamp` name.

Precise clock alignment is a separate quality result. A slow optional clock query
must not by itself turn otherwise qualified arm-state delivery into hardware
ERROR. Where post-command timing is needed to establish gripper completion, that
evidence remains required at the completion/release boundary, with its original
command, generation, deadline and proof instant. Historical completion is not
recertified on every later arm write. A failed required command proof cannot be
downgraded to a quality warning. No new safety threshold is selected here.

This separation follows the distinction between receipt and reconstructed device
time in the [UR RTDE publisher](https://docs.universal-robots.com/Universal_Robots_ROS_Documentation/rolling/doc/ur_rtde_ros2_publisher/doc/usage.html).
Its timing offsets and robot-specific assumptions are not FR5 limits. In
ros2_control, ERROR invokes the hardware lifecycle error path; it is not an
appropriate label for missing optional analysis precision.

The matching manufacturer source at `fairino-cpp-sdk` commit
`0553c35d760a4e76c9b8d2fc0208ca83e6d731cd` exposes a prerequisite: the CNDE receive
thread mutates shared state field by field, while `GetRobotRealTimeState` copies
it without the receive mutex. Reuse that decoder with a short coherent publication
boundary, not another connection or the mutex held across blocking receive.
This source finding is not evidence that recorded datasets are corrupted. Fields
3–75 include the last ServoJ target, but not field 76's command count; neither is
an established same-command completion acknowledgement.

## Why timeout-only qualification is insufficient

The baseline native `refresh_gripper_freshness` before `e7f22e7` allocates
one quarter of the selected age to each RPC and half to the first-query/frame
stage. Its exception path sets `_gripper_error=-5`; `read()` then returns hardware
ERROR. The query already runs outside the main read/write thread, so merely
adding another asynchronous wrapper would not remove this error coupling.

The baseline CPU acquisition characterization at `b9931d6` reproduces rejection
of a 37 ms query under the selected 100 ms policy, while a 2 ms query succeeds without command sends.
This approximates an observed 36.838 ms response tail; it is not a measured
worst-case controller bound. The test intentionally characterizes the current
cutoff; the candidate regression now requires the same bounded acquisition to succeed.

A deterministic native-predicate counterexample is stronger than first-query
success: a hypothetical 74 ms acquisition is valid on publication, but its
original 100 ms lease expires before another serial 74 ms acquisition completes.
This is a synthetic schedule, not a claim that every physical query takes 37 ms.
Thus a remaining-total-budget correction alone needs a renewal test, not just
an initial readiness test.

Compare that correction with a bounded correction of certification scheduling
and error classification. Distinguish a pending/failed refresh while previous
evidence remains valid from actual evidence expiry, source regression,
incarnation change or controller error. Never extend old timestamps, ignore
expiry, replay a motion command or claim safe automatic recovery. Determine
whether certification cadence can sustain the selected bound before changing
fault propagation; moving a query to another thread is not sufficient.

This matches the purpose, not an automatic adoption, of ros2_control's
[asynchronous hardware](https://control.ros.org/jazzy/doc/ros2_control/hardware_interface/doc/asynchronous_components.html).
Its [read/write error handling](https://control.ros.org/jazzy/doc/ros2_control/hardware_interface/doc/handling_errors_during_read_write.html)
also makes hardware ERROR a lifecycle event, not an ordinary retry status.

## Candidate selected by native continuous replay

The first budget-only candidate still failed the repeating 2/2/37 ms CPU query
schedule: the worker added its fixed post-query sleep even when acquisition had
already consumed the reuse horizon. The revised candidate derives the next wait
from the original certificate start and existing reuse horizon, rather than
starting a new sleep budget at publication. RPCs and the frame wait share the
original whole acquisition budget. The age/tolerance, original anchors and
read/write expiry checks are unchanged; no query exception is hidden or downgraded.

This repairs scheduling in the existing asynchronous owner rather than adding a
second sampler, fault/recovery state machine or generic execution layer. Tests
exercise native producer/sampler/write together, accept interspersed tails, and
require zero later sends for sustained delays that exhaust evidence validity.
Mock servo counters are not physical execution evidence. Independent review,
full regression and physical renewal qualification remain required before
runtime promotion; the candidate does not prove that 100 ms is a physical
stopping-distance guarantee or tolerate arbitrary communication delays.

## Required verification before runtime promotion

### Attribute the query path before changing its temporal contract

The installed manufacturer `libfairino.so.2.3.7` remains byte-identical to the
pinned vendor commit. FR5 changes the ROS adapter, including a separate libcurl
`GetSystemClock` client; it has not patched this SDK binary. Repeated query
certification and propagation of its expiry into hardware ERROR are FR5-owned
integration decisions, not evidence that the vendor SDK is defective.

Installed SDK inspection and a read-only native call establish that existing
`GetRobotRealTimeState` consumes a CNDE cache from TCP 20005. Its configuration
readback returns an 8 ms period and fields 3–75, including `RobotTime` and gripper
feedback. `GetRobotRealtimeStateSamplePeriod` instead names TCP 20004 in the
pinned header; a same-name XMLRPC fault cannot disprove a local SDK operation.
Reuse the installed interface before proposing another CNDE connection, changing
its field set/period or adopting a newer SDK. Configured period is not a measured
delivery bound or a new freshness/completion authority. The manufacturer's
[CNDE interface](https://fairino-doc-en.readthedocs.io/latest/RobotCommunication/cnde_introduction.html)
describes streaming feedback, but latest documentation is not installed-firmware
qualification.

Wire and client measurements during bounded current-position hold agree on a
48.6 ms clock-response delay while UDP servo requests continue at roughly 10 ms
intervals with replies. This rules against a comparable userspace scheduling
delay in that sample, not every host/network cause. A later read-only SDK-close
comparison also produced timeouts; controller servo load is not established as
the sole cause. See the handoff's exact artifacts. Do not substitute another RPC
method into q0/frame/q1 proof slots, treat tracing overhead as production timing,
or weaken the lease on these observations. Any correction must account for
current stream age, same-command completion and shutdown effects separately.

Exercise initial acquisition, repeated renewal, isolated and sustained delay,
true expiry, cancellation, source regression and generation changes with the
native producer and read/write consumer. Preserve original HOST anchors, exact
frame enclosure, selected age/tolerance and immutable terminal proof. Show
normal-path throughput as well as zero new sends after invalid evidence.

Then qualify the exact built driver at bounded HOME and the authorized learned
execution path with fresh environment checks. CPU tests alone cannot establish
the physical reaction bound or complete-task success. Original data/checkpoints
and the user-owned vendor worktree stay unchanged.
## LeRobot integration and pick-place continuation (2026-09-12)

The current user-selected task is bidirectional pick-and-place, not a promotion
of the older raw26 pickup probe. LeRobot 0.6.1 owns model inference, saved
processors and its action queue. FR5 adapts their exact outputs into the existing
sole executor and retains device-specific authority, cancellation and actual
transport evidence. Do not implement another policy queue or per-row publisher
to evade full-chunk admission. The current plugin deliberately cannot send;
its CLI's presence is not an execution qualification.

The existing proposal bridge now optionally records a candidate before numerical
validation through the existing EvidenceSink. It preserves exact raw and already
postprocessed chunk bytes without a second processor call, originating observation
identity/timestamps, projected candidate and the original validator result. A
distinct read-only proposal diagnostic replays that validator. It does not invent
a plan, terminal trace or manipulation failure from a velocity rejection.
`NOT_ATTEMPTED` is explicitly scoped to the proposal builder, not a claim about
all commands in the containing run. A storage failure cannot turn rejection into
approval; an unmatched candidate remains incomplete. Event hashes/order detect
accidental changes, not authenticated provenance or power-loss durability.

Read retained attempts with the existing plugin module entry point:

```sh
direnv exec . python3 -m lerobot_strategy_fr5.evidence /path/to/sidecar.jsonl
```

This is the bridge/diagnostic slice, not the full closed loop. The rollout CLI
still needs the existing executor connection. Failure-conditioned pick-place
recollection must preserve both original endpoints, direction and task binding;
the existing pickup-only guard cannot simply be removed. Failed policy actions
are diagnostic data, not automatically expert training targets. Model comparison
uses the approved TRAIN-only normalization and fixed heldout cohort, separately
from online execution qualification. Old data, processors and approval artifacts
remain unchanged.

Offline J6 deviation, gripper error and rejection fractions diagnose hypotheses;
they do not qualify or disqualify a whole checkpoint for physical evaluation.
Additional learning continues independently rather than becoming an execution
dependency. The next current proposal is checked by the existing execution owner.
The `.03` plugin default, `.1` proposal scaling ceiling and five-second finite
budget are selected software contracts, not demonstrated manufacturer limits.
Revising a consumption contract requires explicit semantics and focused evidence,
not an offline-score threshold or silently bypassing the current validator.

For evaluation, the [official SmolVLA results](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolvla)
compare task success, completion time and completed tasks within a fixed time
window. Those are useful complementary outcome measurements, not FR5 admission
thresholds. Until real FR5 outcomes exist, the relationship between offline
action error and task success remains unmeasured here.


## Original-transition recollection (software integration)

The existing acquisition recommendation joins a human-reviewed finite learned
chunk to its original native v4 source program, preapproval resolver receipts,
and episode instruction binding. Retain the destination resolver receipt in the
existing preapproval producer: job metadata participates in its resolved digest,
so reconstructing it from the source job would guess historical inputs. Validate
both endpoint poses, sheets, calibration, family/region identities, object/grasp,
cameras, direction and selected motion preset against the current native catalog.
Missing historical destination or language evidence remains explicitly unavailable.

Use the existing paired DIRECT_EDIT workspace cycle for the exact directed pair.
Current Scene owns the first pose only. If recovery changed that pose within the
source workspace, reserve the next two native cycle edges to return to the original
source, then propose its original destination; reject insufficient caller budget or
unsafe native yaw transitions. Original releases that change yaw are explicitly
unsupported by this yaw-preserving Collection authoring path; never substitute a
next-source yaw reset for the original destination. A different current workspace requires qualified
reposition/selection by the existing operator, not a rewritten failure condition.
The normal advice choice re-reads evidence and the normal compiler consumes the
same paired draft. No semantic classification, Scene writes, execution, data
mutation or approval authority is added. A failed finite chunk remains a reviewed
re-demonstration hypothesis with unknown complete-task effect and data deficit.
